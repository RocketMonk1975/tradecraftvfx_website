Video Placeholder

For your production site, you have several options for video content:

1. Host small videos (under 10MB) directly in this folder
2. Use external video hosting services:
   - Vimeo (recommended for professional use)
   - YouTube 
   - Cloudinary
   - AWS S3

To use the VideoPlayer component with externally hosted videos:
<VideoPlayer src="https://your-video-url.mp4" type="video/mp4" title="Your Video Title" />

For demo purposes, please add a video named "sample.mp4" to this folder.
